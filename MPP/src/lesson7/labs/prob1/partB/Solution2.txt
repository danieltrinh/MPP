The problem is in the equals method, the parameter´s type must be Object superclass instead of Employee, we can cast it to Employee inside the method´s body
public boolean equals(Object obj) 
	{
		Employee other = (Employee) obj;		 
		return other.name.equals(this.name) && other.salary==this.salary;
	}
