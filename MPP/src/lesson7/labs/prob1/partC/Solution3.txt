The problem is on hashCode , is neccesary override hashCode , because is necesary when we work with hashmaps , other wise work with
hashcode of superclass object
@Override
	public int hashCode() {
		final int prime = 31;
		int result = 1;
		result = prime * result + ((name == null) ? 0 : name.hashCode());
		result = prime * result + salary;
		return result;
	}
