If  A is an interface and B and  C are interface
When the type D is a class . : Solution , You could implements B and C and override  method and work 
When the type D is an interface : Solution , You could implements B and C and override  method and work

If  A is an Abstract class  and B and  C are interface
When the type D is a class . : Solution work , because  you can extend from many interfaces 
When the type D is an interface : Solution work , because  you can implements from many interfaces
