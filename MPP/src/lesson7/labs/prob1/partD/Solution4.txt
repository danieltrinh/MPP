// The Keys of the hash need to be immutable , if we change it with tracker.get(e).setVisited(true); we may get incorrect hashmap behavior
//   to ensure consistency, the map key must be immutable.			
			
// There are two solutions for this problem, 
//one is only remove the call to .setVisited(true); in the EmployeeInfo
//two other way is to set the key class (Employee) to be immutable, not allows changes .
